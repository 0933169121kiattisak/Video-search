# Header This code is a React application that creates a video search and playback interface. Let me break down its key components and functionality:

Core Dependencies and Functionality:
Uses react-player for video playback
Uses movie-trailer to fetch movie trailer URLs
Uses React's useState hook for state management


State Variables:
video: Stores the current search input text
videoURL: Stores the URL of the video to be played (defaults to an Inception trailer)
searchedVideo: Stores the name of the currently displayed video
Main Features:
Has a search box where users can enter movie/show names
When the search button is clicked, it:
Updates the displayed video title
Uses movieTrailer to fetch the YouTube URL for that movie's trailer
Updates the video player with the new URL
User Interface Components:
A search section with:
Text label
Input field for movie/show name
Search button
A video section with:

ReactPlayer component that plays the video
Title display showing the currently searched video



Here's a more detailed example of how it works:

User types "The Matrix" in the search box
User clicks search button
Code calls movieTrailer("The Matrix")
When the API returns with a YouTube URL, the video player updates to play The Matrix trailer
The title updates to show "The Matrix"
